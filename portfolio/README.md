# My Portfolio Website

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in visiting my github page.

This is the repository for my [portfolio page](https://bryancampos.netlify.com) built with `Angular 12` and `Bootstrap 5`.

# There's more to be included

There are still dozens of projects locally stored on .zip files and cloud services, waiting to be curated and organized so I can post them on my portfolio (plus the ones I'm currently working on), therefore expect to see more projects every time you visit [my portfolio website](https://bryancampos.netlify.com).

Thank you!
